### Introduction
In the bustling city of New York, the restaurant scene is ever-expanding, catering to the needs of students and busy professionals who rely on convenient dining options due to their hectic lifestyles. As an answer to their culinary demands, online food delivery services have emerged as a lifeline. Among these services, FoodHub, a prominent food aggregator company, stands out by offering a singular smartphone app that provides access to a multitude of restaurants.

Through the FoodHub app, customers can place online orders directly with their preferred restaurants. Once confirmed, a designated delivery person from the company is dispatched to collect the order. Utilizing navigational tools, the delivery personnel reach the restaurant and await the food package. After receiving the order, the delivery person marks the pickup in the app and commences the journey to the customer's location, ultimately delivering the food. Following a successful delivery, the customer can rate the order using the app's interface. The business model of FoodHub involves earning revenue by retaining a fixed percentage of the delivery order's value as a commission from the restaurants.

### Objective
My task as a data scientist is to leverage the extensive order data stored in the company's online portal. By dissecting and analyzing this dataset, valuable insights can be extracted to better understand restaurant demand and subsequently enhance the overall customer experience. The Data Science team has identified crucial questions that necessitate answers for business improvement. This project involves conducting in-depth data analysis that also involve the use of statistical method like ANOVA test and MANN WHITNEY U test to address these inquiries, thus aiding the company in refining its operations and strategies.

Data Description:
The dataset encompasses a variety of information pertaining to food orders. The data dictionary provided outlines the essential attributes, each offering insights into the orders placed through the FoodHub app. Attributes such as order_id, customer_id, restaurant_name, cuisine_type, cost, day_of_the_week, rating, food_preparation_time, and delivery_time are key components of the dataset. With this comprehensive dataset, an opportunity arises to delve into the intricacies of customer behavior and operational efficiency, ultimately steering the company towards informed decision-making and positive growth.
